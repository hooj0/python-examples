# Multiple-line strings literal block(using |)
# 缩进为4个空格，保留格式，其中换行也正常显示，，顶头对齐不算换行
literal_block: |
    This entire block of text will be the value of the 'literal_block' key,
    with line breaks being preserved.

    The literal continues until de-dented, and the leading indentation is
    stripped.

        Any lines that are 'more-indented' keep the rest of their indentation -
        these lines will be indented by 4 spaces.

# Multiple-line strings folded block(using >)   
# 保留缩进，强制空行算一个换行，顶头对齐不算换行     
folded_style: >
    This entire block of text will be the value of 'folded_style', but this
    time, all newlines will be replaced with a single space.

    Blank lines, like above, are converted to a newline character.

        'More-indented' lines keep their newlines, too -
        this text will appear over two lines.
